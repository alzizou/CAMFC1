# CAMFC1

This folder includes the files for simulating the Cooperative Adaptive Model-Free (CAMFC1) algorithm on a team of four quadrotors
in MATLAB/SIMULINK. 
The CAMFC1 algorithm does not require the relative measurements over the states of neighboring agents in a network of 
dynamic agents. 

The CAMFC1 algorithm can be found in the following link
